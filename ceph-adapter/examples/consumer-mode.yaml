# Example: Consumer mode
#
# Use this when connecting to a Rook-Ceph cluster running in another
# Kubernetes cluster (external/consumer cluster setup).
#
# Features:
#   - Auto-discovers mon_host from imported Rook resources
#   - Exports CSI provisioner keyring (csi-rbd-provisioner)
#   - Limited permissions (no user/pool creation)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Rook external cluster resources imported via import-external-cluster.sh
#   - Pools and users pre-created on the provider cluster
#   - Network connectivity to provider cluster's Ceph monitors
#
# Important:
#   - OpenStack storage-init jobs must be DISABLED (no admin access)
#   - Set in Cinder values: manifests.job_storage_init: false
#   - Set in Cinder values: manifests.job_backup_storage_init: false
#
# Deploy with:
#   helm upgrade --install ceph-adapter-rook ./ceph-adapter-rook \
#     --namespace=openstack \
#     --create-namespace \
#     --set cluster.mode=consumer \
#     --set cluster.namespace=rook-ceph
