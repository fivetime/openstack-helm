# Example: Provider mode (default)
#
# Use this when Rook-Ceph is deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster
# with full administrative access. This is the default mode.
#
# Features:
#   - Auto-discovers mon_host from Rook resources
#   - Exports admin keyring (client.admin)
#   - Supports OpenStack storage-init jobs (user/pool creation)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Rook-Ceph cluster deployed and healthy
#   - Admin access to the Rook-Ceph cluster
#
# Deploy with:
#   helm upgrade --install ceph-adapter-rook ./ceph-adapter-rook \
#     --namespace=openstack \
#     --create-namespace \
#     -f examples/provider-mode.yaml
#
# Or simply use defaults (provider mode is default):
#   helm upgrade --install ceph-adapter-rook ./ceph-adapter-rook \
#     --namespace=openstack \
#     --create-namespace

deployment:
  mode: provider

provider:
  # Namespace where Rook-Ceph cluster is deployed
  cluster_namespace: rook-ceph

  # Rook mon endpoints configmap name
  mon_endpoints_configmap: rook-ceph-mon-endpoints

  # Rook mon secret containing admin keyring
  admin_secret: rook-ceph-mon

output:
  # Secret name for the Ceph client keyring
  secret_name: pvc-ceph-client-key

  # ConfigMap name for ceph.conf
  configmap_name: ceph-etc

conf:
  ceph:
    global:
      auth_cluster_required: cephx
      auth_service_required: cephx
      auth_client_required: cephx
