# Example: Provider mode (default)
#
# Use this when Rook-Ceph is deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster
# with full administrative access. This is the default mode.
#
# Features:
#   - Auto-discovers mon_host from Rook resources
#   - Exports admin keyring (client.admin)
#   - Supports OpenStack storage-init jobs (user/pool creation)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Rook-Ceph cluster deployed and healthy
#   - Admin access to the Rook-Ceph cluster
#
# Deploy with:
#   helm upgrade --install ceph-adapter-rook ./ceph-adapter-rook \
#     --namespace=openstack \
#     --create-namespace \
#     --set cluster.namespace=rook-ceph
#
# Or simply use all defaults:
#   helm upgrade --install ceph-adapter-rook ./ceph-adapter-rook \
#     --namespace=openstack

cluster:
  mode: provider
  namespace: rook-ceph
  mon_endpoints_configmap: rook-ceph-mon-endpoints
  admin_secret: rook-ceph-mon

output:
  secret_name: pvc-ceph-client-key
  configmap_name: ceph-etc
