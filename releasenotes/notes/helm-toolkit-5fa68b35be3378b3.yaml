    Removing non-used script which allows to create bucket using admin user.
    Actually any user can do this and there is better script which is
    utilized by elasticsearch chart:
    elasticsearch/templates/bin/_create_s3_buckets.sh.tpl
    The only requirement is - to create the user.
    Also, removing S3_ADMIN_<> env vars from job manifests
    (see helm-toolkit.snippets.rgw_s3_admin_env_vars)
    because those vars are not used by actual scripts.
    We now use ceph.conf and keyring to create a user.
    ceph.conf and keyring can be provisioned by either
    ceph chart or ceph-adapter-rook chart.
