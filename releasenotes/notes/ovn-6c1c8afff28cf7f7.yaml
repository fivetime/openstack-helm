    This change introduces the use of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) mounted at /var/lib/ovn
    to store OVN database files (ovnnb_db.db and ovnsb_db.db). Previously, the OVN databases
    were stored on ephemeral pod storage, which caused the databases to be lost whenever the
    OVN pods were restarted. This resulted in network outages and forced a full synchronization
    between the Neutron database and OVN, impacting cluster stability.
    The issue was introduced by commit ffd183a164be190afcc2ce4de27de7e72ab8d386, which caused
    problems during OVN upgrades due to the lack of persistent storage.
    By storing the OVN databases on a persistent volume, pod restarts and upgrades can be
    performed safely without data loss or network disruption.
